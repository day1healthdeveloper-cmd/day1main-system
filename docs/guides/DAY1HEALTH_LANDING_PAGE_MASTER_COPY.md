### PROBLEM REFRAME

**Heading**  
Medical cover doesn't fail people. Delay does.

**Body**  
Most South Africans don't avoid medical cover because they don't care. They delay because it feels complicated, overwhelming, and slow.

Big decisions. Too many options. Too much fine print.

Day1Health was built to remove that delay — without cutting corners.
